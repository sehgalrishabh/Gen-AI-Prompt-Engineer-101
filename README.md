# Gen AI Prompt Engineer 101: From Basics to Mastery (2026 Edition)

A structured, engineering-oriented handbook for mastering prompt engineering with Large Language Models (LLMs), multimodal systems, and AI agents.  
This repository is organized as a technical book written entirely in Markdown and designed for direct use on GitHub.

The focus is practical execution: frameworks, templates, workflows, and production-ready methods.

## Summary

Prompt engineering is now a core technical skill for building reliable AI systems.  
This book formalizes the discipline into clear methods that enable predictable outputs, repeatable workflows, and measurable quality.

Topics progress from fundamentals to advanced techniques including reasoning strategies, multimodal prompts, reusable frameworks, and agent-based automation.
