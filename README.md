# Gen AI Prompt Engineer 101: From Basics to Mastery (2026 Edition)

A professional, beginner-to-master learning repository for **prompt engineering in the generative AI era**.

This book is designed as a chapter-based Markdown curriculum for GitHub, helping learners build practical skills from foundations to advanced agentic workflows.

---

## Scope

This course covers:

- Core prompt engineering principles and mental models
- How LLM behavior is shaped by tokens, context, and sampling
- Practical prompting patterns from zero-shot to structured frameworks
- Advanced reasoning and multimodal prompting
- Career application: portfolio building, freelancing, consulting, and monetization
- The shift from prompting chatbots to orchestrating AI agents

This course does **not** require deep ML research background to start.

---

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, learners will be able to:

- Write precise, controllable prompts for diverse tasks
- Select the right prompting strategy for quality, speed, and cost
- Apply frameworks such as CoT and CO-STAR in real workflows
- Design prompts for text, image, video, and audio tasks
- Build a professional prompt portfolio
- Convert prompting skills into income opportunities
- Prepare for agent-based autonomous AI systems

## How to Study Each Chapter

Use this loop for maximum retention:

1. Read the chapter once for concepts.
2. Re-read only templates, frameworks, and flowcharts.
3. Complete the chapter practical exercise.
4. Test your prompt on multiple inputs.
5. Score outputs and revise.
6. Save your best prompt as a reusable asset.

## Repository Authoring Rule

To keep quality high and workflow controlled:

- Only create or update the chapter/file explicitly requested.
- Full-book generation is done only when explicitly requested.
- Do not generate the full book in one pass unless explicitly requested.
- Keep tone professional, educational, and structured.
- Use mermaid flowcharts where they improve understanding for visual learners.
